# Wrangle and Analyze a Dataset: WeRateDogs Twitter Archive

## Introduction 
This project is the final task for part 4 of the Udacity Data Analyst Nano Degree. 

The project consists in creating a jupyter notebook to perform data wrangling tasks on a given dataset. 

## Learning objectives
- Data wrangling, which consists of:
    - Gathering data (downloadable file in the Resources tab in the left most panel of your classroom and linked in step 1 below).
    - Assessing data
- Cleaning data
- Storing, analyzing, and visualizing your wrangled data
- Reporting on 1) your data wrangling efforts and 2) your data analyses and visualizations

## Analysis Description

The dataset that will be wrangling (and analyzing and visualizing) in this project is the tweet archive of Twitter user [@dog_rates](https://twitter.com/dog_rates), also known as [WeRateDogs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WeRateDogs). 

WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. These ratings almost always have a denominator of 10. The numerators, though? Almost always greater than 10. 11/10, 12/10, 13/10, etc. 
Why? 
Because ["they're good dogs Brent."](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/001/225/812/2b3.png)

WeRateDogs has over 4 million followers and has received international media coverage.

## Contents

* wrangle_act.ipynb file where the analysis has been developed, contains code with Markdown cells from Jupyter Notebook.
* .html file output of the .ipynb converted to web version for easy viewing
* twitter_archive_master.csv file with the clean data used 
* wrangle_report.pdf file with a written report about the wrangling efforts. This is to be framed as an internal document.
* act_report.pdf file with a written report that communicates the insights and displays the visualization(s) produced from the wrangled data. This is to be framed as an external document, like a blog post or magazine article.
